- 🪬 Hi, call me Quinn.
- 📫 My Hobbies are Art, Coding, Spirituality, Fitness, & Mental Health.
- 👀 Blockchain, NFTs, & Crypto are really interesting to me and I love building with the tech.
- 💞️ I love food.

- I get most of my work freelancing websites and Blockchain tends to be what I spend my freetime on.



My Two Most Recent Projects Are A Gym Exercise App & A DeFi Exchange For A Cryptocurrency I Invented.
They were super fun to build and I'm excited to build more.
