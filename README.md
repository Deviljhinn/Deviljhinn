- 🪬 Hi, I'm James.
- Art/Coding/Fitness/Mental Health.
- 👀 I'm building with Blockchain tech and I enjoy it. (websites, defi, nfts, crypto, etc.)

Most of my work comes from freelancing, but I'm looking to see how a company works.


My Two Most Recent Projects Are A Gym Exercise App & A DeFi Exchange For A Cryptocurrency I Invented.
They were super fun to build and I'm excited to build more.

[Fitness App] https://deviljhinn.github.io/gym_exercises/
